# Python-Challenge

In the "PyBank" file I created a Python script for analyzing the financial records of a company. From the set of financial data budget_data.csv, I successfully calculated each of the following:

  * The total number of months included in the dataset

  * The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

  * The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

  * The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

  * The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

In addition, my final script both prints the analysis to the terminal and exports a text file with the results. 


In the "PyPoll" file, I have helped a small, rural town modernize its vote counting process. Based on the data in election_data.csv, I created a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following:

  * The total number of votes cast

  * A complete list of candidates who received votes

  * The percentage of votes each candidate won

  * The total number of votes each candidate won

  * The winner of the election based on popular vote.

Similarly, my final script both prints the analysis to the terminal and exports a text file with the results.
